# Piggy Game
Piggy Game is a two-player game where players take turns in rolling a dice to accumulate points. The first player to reach 100 points wins. Players can choose to deposit their temporary points into a piggy bank to make them permanent, but this will make them lose their turn. Rolling a 1 will cause the player to lose all their temporary points and their turn.

## Features
Simple interface with clear instructions. Roll the dice by clicking the "Roll" button. The number on the dice represents the number of points you've earned. Choose to either roll again or deposit your temporary points into your piggy bank by clicking the "Hold" button. If you roll a 1, all your temporary points will be lost, and your turn will be over. The game will continue until one player reaches 100 points, and that player wins the game. Click the "New Game" button to start a new game.
